A treasure trove of information about Pillars of Eternity II

## Project Structure

### Quarry (`/quarry`)
The data extraction and processing pipeline that builds our knowledge base. This directory contains tools for:
- Scraping game data (abilities, items) from the official wiki
- Processing and structuring the data using LLMs
- Creating a searchable index of game mechanics
- Validating the processed data

See the [quarry README](quarry/README.md) for detailed information about the data processing pipeline and usage instructions.
